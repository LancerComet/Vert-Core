# Vert

Vert is a type of best practice for building a middle or large scale web application which is based on vue. It will help you to ease your pain when you face a huge project.

Vert provides its own design pattern with several extra APIs, so maybe you should obey its rules and build your project in its design pattern.

There should not be much pain when you using it. If you feel bad about it, just do not use it.
